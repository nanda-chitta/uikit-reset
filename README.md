# Uikit::Reset

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/uikit/reset`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'uikit-reset'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install uikit-reset

## Usage

 Add UIkit::Reset to your CSS

   Append the following line to your app/assets/stylesheets/application.css file:

     *= require uikit-reset

   If you are planning on using Sass, then you will want to rename application.css to application.scss. That file should then look like:

     @import "uikit-reset";

 Add UIkit::Reset to your JS

   Append the following line to your app/assets/javascripts/application.js file:

     //= require uikit-reset
